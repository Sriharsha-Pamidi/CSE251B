# CSE251B - Principles of Machine Learning: Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition
CSE251B Assignments 

- **Traffic Sign Classification using Logistic Regression and Softmax Regression classifiers** \
We have classified traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset using stochastic and batch gradient descent to update the weights in logistic and softmax regression

- **Image Classification using Multi-layer Neural Networks** \
We have classified images on CIFAR-10 dataset, we have used multi-layer neural networks with softmax outputs for classification. we have implemented the multi-layer neural network from gorund-up. 

- **Fully Convolutional Network for Semantic Segmentation** \ 
We have used TAS500 for semantic segmentation task. we have used 9 categories for semantic segmentation. We have trained a SegNet from scratch to predict the segmentation masks of the images and also explored deep CNN architectures like SegNet, resNet, U-Net.

- **Image Captioning using ResNet + LSTM** \
We explored Recurrent Neural Networks to solve problems having a sequential structure. We specifically produced captions for images. We used an encoder-decoder architecture to accomplish this. Simply put, the encoder takes an image as input and converts it into a vector of feature values. This is then processed through a linear layer before being fed into the LSTM. At each step, the LSTM will be trained to anticipate the next word. As the encoder, we used a pre-trained convolutional network, and the decoder was just an LSTM model.
