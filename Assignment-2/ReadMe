To Run the model:

1) change the layer_specs in config.yaml to layer_specs: [3072, 64, 64, 10]
layer_specs: [784, 50, 50, 10] -- is used to get the values in sync with the checker.

2) use command python3 neuralnet.py



To Run the checker:
1) check the layer_specs in config.yaml if they are compatible with the values coded in the checker.

2)use command python3 checker.py
